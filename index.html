						If you take the time out to read the book of Deuteronomy 28:1-14, you will see that these  <br />
						are blessings upon the Yisraelites if they are obedient, and keep the covenant of The Most High. 
						
						However, <br /> Deuteronomy 28:15-68 shows the curses among Yisrael if they 
						fail to keep The Most Highs instructions (Torah).<br />
						
						In order to find the Yisraelites today, we will focus on the 
						curses of deuteronomy, because the Yisraelites <br /> (as stated in the book 
						of Jeremiah 9:13,16) failed to keep the instructions of The Most High, 
						and whomever are <br /> suffering these curses today are the true Yisraelites.

						[22] And this is the copie of the Epistle which (the Senate) wrote backe againe, 
						in tables of brasse: <br /> and sent to Ierusalem, that there they might haue by them 
						a memorial of peace & confederacy.<br /><br />

						[23] Good successe be to the Romans and to the people of the Iewes, by Sea,
						and by <br /> land for euer: the sword also and enemie, be farre from them.<br /><br />

						[24] If there come first any warre vpon the Romans or any of their confederats t
						hroughout all their dominion,<br />

						[25] The people of the Iewes shall helpe them, as the time shall be appointed, 
						with all their heart.<br />

						[26] Neither shal they giue any thing, vnto them that make war vpon them, or 
						aide them with victuals, weapons, money, <br /> or ships, as it hath seemed good vnto 
						the Romans,but they shall keepe their couenant without taking any thing therefore.<br />

						[27] In the same maner also, if warre come first vpon the nation of the Iewes,
						the Romans shall <br /> helpe them with all their heart, according as the time shall be appointed them.<br />

						[28] Neither shal victuals be giuen to thē that take part against thē, or weapons,

						their couenants, and that without deceit.<br />

						[29] According to these articles did the Romanes make a covenant with the people of the Iewes.<br />
						
						<br />
						
						During the time of revolt, the Maccabees were supported by the up-and-coming 
						Romans (1 Maccabees 8; 15:15–24). <br /> As the power of Rome grew, it became an empire 
						and swallowed up Israel/Palestine. <br /> The Jews were allowed to maintain their 
						religious practices as long as they did not make trouble for Rome. Rome placed 
						a series <br /> of puppet kings (the Herod family) and military governors  
						(e.g., Pilate, Felix, Festus) over various provinces of Palestine.
						
						<br />
						
						Then, the Romans would eventually destroy the set apart temple, exiling the Yis'ra'elites.

						<p>In the U.S. much of the so called African American history 
						is not mentioned. It usually starts out as our people <br /> being brought to America on Slave ships 
						(during the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade) but who were we before <br /> this horrible event took place? 
						What were we doing on the West Coast Of Africa before the European enslaved us? <br /> How did we get 
						to the West Coast of Africa? Why were we there?Why is it so <br />  important to keep 
						the history of the so called Negro hidden?
						
						
						
						<br /><br /> 
						
						In the last section we left off with the Romans exiling Yaosharal.</p>
						 
						<p>During the Roman invasion in 70 A.D.
						smany Jews fled into West Africa, where for 1200 years they ruled dynasties. <br /> 
						In the book <i id ="i3">'From Babylon To Timbuktu Rudolph R.Windsor'</i>  writes...<br /><br />
						
						<i id ="i3">'The black Jews had an advantage over the African tribes: they carried their culture, history, laws, 
						and written records <br />  with them; this assured them a constant precedent for the development of a higher social organization'....

						<p>We are not taught this in the school curriculums, here in America, nor is it taught in the average church.<br />
						The goal is to keep the (so called blacks) as far away from our history as possible because if we were <br /> to return

							<td class="description"><br /><br /><br /> By continuing to disobey the laws of YA'OH, slavery has become an 
						 <br /> recurring theme for our people (Yis'ra'elites). The Yis'ra'elites were enslaved in the Egyptian, Assyrian,  <br />  Babylonian, Persian, Greek,and Roman Empires.
						They were even slaves during different <br /> periods of the Judges. 
						
						
						
						
						
						Also, today we are being held captive in the lands of our enemies. <br /> 
						During the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade the tribe of Yaodah (Judah) was captured 
						and <br /> dispersed into the four corners of the earth. (More on this later)

						<br /> 
						
						[68] And the Lord shall bring thee into <b>Egypt again with ships</b>, <br /> by the way whereof
 							I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it <br /> no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for

 							<br /> <br /> 
 							
 						First, what we have to comprehend is that Egypt in this verse is
 						 referring to the house of bondage.
 						 
 						 <br /><br /> 
 						 
 						Exodus 13:3
 						
 						<br /> 
 						 
						[3] And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which 
						ye came out from <b>Egypt</b>, <br /> out of the <b>house of bondage</b>;
						for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from <br /> this place: 
						there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
						
						<br /> <br /> 

						So since Egypt is the house of bondage now we properly read 
						Deuteronomy 28:68 in the way that it should be read.
